# ü§ñ Robot Control Mobile App

</br>This project entitled <b>‚ÄúDevelopment of a Mobile Application to Control the P-Guard Robot‚Äù</b> was part of my internship with Enova Robotics.
The app offers a fully remote solution for security guards to control the robot, send command requests and receive responses and alerts in real time.

# Robot-Control-App
A mobile application built with flutter for the remote control of a security robot.

## About 
This project entitled <b>“Development of a Mobile Application to Control the P-Guard Robot”</b> was part of my internship with Enova Robotics.
The app enables security guards to remotely connect to the P-Guard robot across different networks, send command requests and receive responses and alerts in real time. Overall the app offers a fully remote solution for the control of the robot and its connected devices through a portable and simplified graphical interface.
